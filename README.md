## üöÄ How to Use

1.  Open `index.html` in any web browser.
2.  Select the item you want to enchant (e.g., Diamond Sword).
3.  Check the boxes for your desired enchantments and set their levels.
4.  Click **"Calculate Optimal Order"**.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

The calculator uses a **recursive algorithm with memoization** (dynamic programming) to efficiently explore all possible combination sequences. It accurately models the official Minecraft: Java Edition anvil mechanics, including:

-   **Prior Work Penalty:** The increasing cost of working on an item multiple times.
-   **Enchantment Costs:** The specific XP cost multiplier for each enchantment.
-   **Combining Rules:** The logic for merging and upgrading enchantments.

By evaluating every path, it guarantees the true optimal solution with the lowest total XP cost.

## üíª Technology Stack
